# cfgdepsmethod_r

This package demonstrates a configuration and dependency injection approach that is analogous to push-to-function but uses a struct to represent the combination of config and dependencies and implements a `run` method that uses the config and depedencies to represent the configured function.

This variant uses dependencies by reference.
